ubertooth (2017-03-R2) unstable; urgency=low
  * USB API versioning - We have added USB API versioning to improve the
    experience of failures due to mismatched firmware and host code. You may
    find that Ubertooth tools complain that your firmware is out of date.
    Updating firmware is simple and reliable, please follow the instructions
    on the wiki. A release archive with precompiled firmware is available.
  * Basic Rate PCAP output - the pcap file produced by the Ubertooth tools
    should all be read by the latest Wireshark versions without the need to
    install plugins.
  * Kismet plugins - Kismet is currently under heavy development and it has
    not been possible to continue tracking the master branch. The legacy
    Kismet plugins should continue to work, but we will wait to track git
    master until development has stabalised.

 ubertooth (2015-09-R2) unstable; urgency=low
  * Basic Rate Bluetooth Improvements
      * Stability has improved in performance constrained environments
      * The "uh oh, buffer not emptied" issue no longer causes the tools to loop
        indefinitely
      * AFH support has greatly improved, UAP and CLK values are now found more
        quickly when AFH is used
  * Basic Rate PCAP support
      * ubertooth-rx and ubertooth-follow support a new PCAP file format
      * The new PCAP format is also supported with a new Wireshark plugin: btbredr
      * The PCAP format is still in the early stages, but we hope to have the plugin
        included in Wireshark later this year
      * The older btbb format is still produced by the Kismet plugins, they will
        be migrated over to the new format in the next release
  * Bluetooth Smart (BLE) Improvements
      * Improved packet reception
      * Promiscuous sniffing mode is more reliable
      * Promiscuous sniffing reports the recovered parameters to the host
  * Skateboard Hacking
      * Support for interfering with connections of BLE enabled skateboards
      * ubertooth-ego targets Yuneec E-go (not Bluetooth)
      * Always hack safely and responsibly!
