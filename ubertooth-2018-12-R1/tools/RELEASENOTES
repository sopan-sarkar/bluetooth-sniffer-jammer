Ubertooth 2018-12-R1 Release Notes

greater.

Changes
-------

**Uberducky triggering** - Uberducky is a new project built on Ubertooth
hardware that acts like a USB Rubber Ducky. You can use a second
Ubertooth to trigger it to inject keystrokes using the `ubertooth-ducky`
command. See the [Uberducky repo](https://github.com/mikeryan/uberducky)
for more info.

**Spectrum Analyzer UI improvements** - Thank you Steven Haussmann and
Andrew Browning!

**Bug fixes** - Improvements to `ubertooth-btle`'s faux slave mode.

**USB API version** - As with the previous release, we are using USB API
versioning to improve the experience of failures due to mismatched
firmware and host code. As of this release, the USB API has been bumped
to 1.06. If the Ubertooth tools complain that your firmware is out of
date, please update your firmware. Updating firmware is simple and
reliable, please follow the instructions on the wiki
https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/wiki/Firmware
A release archive with precompiled firmware is available from
https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/releases/download/2018-12-R1/ubertooth-2018-12-R1.tar.xz
