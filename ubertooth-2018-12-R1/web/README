This is the source directory for the Project Ubertooth web site, including all
project documentation.  To browse the content online, visit:

http://ubertooth.sourceforge.net/

If you have downloaded this material and would like to browse the content
locally, point your browser to the file:

output/index.html

Everything below this point other than the output directory is source material
for automatic generation of the web site.  If you would like to contribute to the
web site, you should learn how to use the nanoc site compiler by going through
the short tutorial at:

http://nanoc.stoneship.org/

Most contributions would basically go like this: edit content files, run "nanoc
compile", test locally, and commit to svn.
