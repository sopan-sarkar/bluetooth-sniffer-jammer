<h1>Ubertooth One</h1>

<p>Ubertooth One is the next generation hardware platform of Project Ubertooth.
It supersedes <a href="../zero/">Ubertooth Zero</a> and is currently the
preferred platform.</p>

<h2>design</h2>

<p>Ubertooth One was designed in <a
href="http://kicad.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">KiCad</a>, an open
source electronic design automation software package, with surface mount
components suitable for <a

<p>This diagram shows the location of LEDs and the pins of the expansion
connector.</p>

<p>LED guide:</p>

<ul>
	<li>RST: indicates that the LPC175x is powered on. This should always be on
	during operation except during a full reset of the LPC175x (e.g., while
	entering ISP mode).</li>
	<li>1V8: indicates that the CC2400 is being supplied with 1.8 V. Control of
	this supply depends on firmware. 1V8 power is required to activate the
	crystal oscillator which is required to activate USB.</li>
	<li>USB: indicates that USB has passed enumeration and configuration.</li>
	<li>TX: Control of this LED depends on firmware. It typically indicates
	radio transmission.</li>
	<li>RX: Control of this LED depends on firmware. It typically indicates
	radio reception.</li>
	<li>USR: Control of this LED depends on firmware.</li>
</ul>

<p>The TX, RX, and USR LEDs blink in a distinctive chasing pattern when the
bootloader is ready to accept USB DFU commands.</p>
