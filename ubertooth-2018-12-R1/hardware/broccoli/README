project code name: Broccoli

Trying out another wireless transceiver IC (TRC104).  It isn't finished yet.
There are problems with the TRC104 oscillator that need to be resolved before
testing can be completed.  Firmware for this design is being developed in
branches/broccoli but the hardware is in trunk.

hardware notes:

Schematic and layout files were designed in KiCad, an open source electronic
design automation package.
