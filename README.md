# bluetooth-sniffer-jammer
[Under Development] This is a modification to the Ubertooth One firmware developed by Great Scott Gadgets. The modified firmware is able to sniff and follow ble devices in connectesd state, jam and de-synchronize the target BLE devices.
The jamming is done by sending a fake packet with a header same as the master in the window intervel when the slave tries to synchronize with the master.
